how are we going to do this?

->architecture (block level) should be identical to RTL
->I/O (block level) should be identical to RTL
->register map should be identical to RTL

How to transiton from floating point algorithm to fix point cycle true
	-underlying doubles (machine supported)
	-use functions to explicitly apply round/trunc.

Tb should be seperate from code.

Algorithm models should be separate from hw implementation.
But don't want to look after multiple models
System options should be separate from hw register options
		-should use the same mechanism in high level design


	directory structure:
		-design
	    	-model
				-env
					-analog models
					-channel models
				-hw
					-tx
					-rx
			-tb     
		-FinalSolution
			-hw(hardware)
			-sw(software)
			-fw(firmware)
			-tb(testbenches)
			-blt(block level testbenches)


So start with cmd name lets say proj.
proj new <name>
